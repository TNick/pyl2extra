Overview
============


This repository contains code that extends the Pylearn2_ library,
a Machine Learning library based on [Theano]theano_.

The structure of the code tries to mimic that of the
Pylearn2_ library. Some support files (
``LICENSE.txt``, ``MANIFEST.in``, ``setup.py``, etc) were reused.

Pylearn2_ was also added as a submodule, so you can:

::

    git clone https://github.com/TNick/pyl2extra.git
    cd pyl2extra
    git submodule update --init

The ``setup.py`` script will look for ``pylearn2`` directory and, if present,
will call it just like you would:

::

    cd pylearn2
    python setup.py develop --user

Please note that I am in no way affiliated with
the folks at Lisa_ lab that developed Pylearn2_ library.

Highlights
----------

This section gives some hints about the content. It will probably
get out of sync pretty fast, so please check the content of the package.

- yaml_parser: some goodies were added to allow extracting
  values from classes and ranges of values that generate a new value
  at each instantiation.

Upcoming Features
-----------------

A visual debugger is in the making that allows
you to visualize the parameters
of your model, images in the dataset, run it one
epoch at a time, track the progress.
The front-end GUI interface may run on a different machine than
the one doing actual training.

The debugger uses PyQt4_ for GUI, PyQtGraph_ for nice graphs
and ZMQ_ for networking.
